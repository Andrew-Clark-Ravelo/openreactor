# HV System

Mains AC -> Variac -> MOTs -> full bridge rectifier -> cockroft multiplier -> feedthrough

## Feedthrough

- Glass/ceramic insulator covering center conductor
- Round end nut on top of threaded connector
- Oil-filled PVC tube around outer ceramic insulator

Reactor chassis grounded to mains

TODO: Can we have a shared ground between the HVDC side and the secondary side of the MOT stack? I know we can (and should) have the MOT casing AC grounded.
